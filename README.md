# Dankest Konami

Sure, there are many Konami code libraries out there but this one is as dank as they come. This project was created as part of a pair programming workshop.

## Install the dependencies

Step 1: Install it as a dependency.

```bash
$ yarn add dankest-konami
```

Step 2: Add it to your project.
```javascript
import Konami from 'dankist-konami'

const konami = new Konami()

// create on success action
konami.onSuccess = () => {
  // Do something cool
}
```

Step 3: Set back and enjoy.
